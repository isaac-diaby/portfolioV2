### Project Overview
This is a Open Source Location FingerPrinting project that I created as part of my CMP320 coursework.
The aim of this project was to create a system that could scrape the web for location data and use it to automate the detection physical security systems.

### What does it do?
- The Application uses a website to scrape location data from target site or you can simple pass it an address.
- We use a combination of open street map and the google maps API to get the location data and images of the area.
- I trained a YOLOv5 model to detect security cameras and walls in the images and alert the user if there are any in the area.
- We the display the data in a web interface that the user can interact with.
