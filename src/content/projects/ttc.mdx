### Project Overview
As part of my University CMP204 coursework, I need to create a site about music using PHP.

I created a 'favourite song app' for some of Tyler the creator's songs which made use of the maria database to store DataTransfer.

### Main Features
 - **Authentication system**: users could login and register to the site which follows best practices for password hashing and salting. I also used sessions to keep the user logged in.
 - **Like system**: users could like their favourite songs and the number of likes would be displayed on the song card.
 - **Database**: I used MariaDB to store the user data and the song data.
 - **Styling**: I used pure CSS to style the site and make it look good.
 - **Responsive**: The site is responsive and works on all devices.

It was a fun project to work on and but since i've been working on websites before this it was quite straight forward. i had learned alot about PHP and its SQL injection prevention strategys.
