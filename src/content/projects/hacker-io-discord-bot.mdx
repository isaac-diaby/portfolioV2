Join your friends, hack your enemies and develop your hacking skills. This bot is a fun hacking simulated game with hacks, levelling up, mini-games like connect 4, global rankings and weekly updates! Join in the fight to become the best hacker!
HackerIo is a Discord bot that tests players [Metasploitable](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/requirements/) commands to successfully hack and steal other players cryptos and reach higher levels. additionally there is an extendable library of mini games (connect 4)
Required Technologies for this application:
- NodeJs
- Typescript
- Discord.js
- MongoDB
- Heroku

I transformed the Discord.js library into TS because I wanted strong typing and structure to the project, this makes it easier for future development. I used MongoDB to save account details like their online status, amount of crypto, current level and other important information.
Disclaimer
HackerIO is just an educational simulated game! You do learn some real hacking skills, pls be responsible with what you learn!
