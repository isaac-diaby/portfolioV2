### Project Overview
This is my implementation of a quant trading framework inspired by frameworks such as QuantConnect and Blankly. The main idea is to create a workflow that allows users to create their trading strategy and execute complex trades with dependencies and a Risk-first approach.

The framework is well documented in the codebase if you want to take a look at how it works.
