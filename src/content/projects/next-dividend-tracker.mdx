What does it do?
- The Application takes a list of stock Tickers that issue dividends and outputs their Ex-dividend data, Payout date, Dividend yield and the amount that is paid out.

- The Application can also take in a second stock list that has your holdings. From which the program will tell you how much you should earn from each holding
- All this will be displayed via the command line in a clean table.
Why I created this?
  
I needed a way to quickly see if the stock holdings in my holding were close to going Ex-div so that I could expect income from them. I found it annoying manually going to sites like SeekingAlpha and manually checking it for each of my holdings.
