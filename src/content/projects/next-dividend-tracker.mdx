### Project Overview
I needed a way to quickly see if the stock holdings in my portfolio and which one of them were close to going Ex-div so that I could expect income from them. I found it annoying manually going to sites like SeekingAlpha and manually checking it for each of my holdings.
so a built a simple python script that would do it for me.

### What does it do?
- The Application takes a list of stock Tickers that issue dividends and outputs their Ex-dividend data, Payout date, Dividend yield and the amount that is paid out.

- The Application can also take in a second stock list that has your holdings. From which the program will tell you how much you should earn from each holding
- All this will be displayed via the command line in a clean table.
Why I created this?

### Final Thoughts
This was the first time i built something for my passion for investing and it was a fun little project to work on. I learned a bit more about web scraping and how to use it to get the data i needed. 
A nice gem of a package was **tabulate** to display data in a clean table.
