My portfolio uses Nuxt to server-side render the application and Contentful as my content management system (CMS). I've created all CSS design and responsive screens myself with no external library. 
The aim of this site is to demonstrate my web design skills with nuxt and my ability to utilise an API (Contentful) in a real-world application.  in doing so updating my portfolio with any new projects or job roles  Is many users friendly.
I really focused on the responsiveness of the website so that it would look attractive in the classic dimensions. (desktop, tablet and of course mobile)
This was a fun little project as it allowed me to create something that i would be updating over time and i could keep improving upon.
