### Project Overview
The aim of this site is to demonstrate my web design skills with nuxt and my ability to utilise an API (Contentful) in a real-world application.  in doing so updating my portfolio with any new projects or job roles  Is users friendly.
I really focused on the responsiveness of the website so that it would look attractive in the classic dimensions. (desktop, tablet and of course mobile)

### Highlights
 - Built with Nuxt to server-side render the application
 - I've created all CSS design and responsive screens myself with no external library. 
 - I've used Contentful as my CMS to manage my projects and blog posts.

### Final Thoughts
This was a fun little project as it allowed me to create something that i could use to showcase some of my work and i would be updating over time and i could keep improving upon. 
of course ive since moved on to a new portfolio but this was a great stepping stone for me to get to where i am now. This one is built on Astro and i'm really happy with the result and speed so far.
